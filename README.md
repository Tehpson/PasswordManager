# PasswordManager

### OBS!!!! This program is a proof of concept. If you are going to use this I highly recommend at least changing the encryption. 

This is a offline password manager, that generate a random string with 20 character that could be used for password.
It also saves the password so you can access it later after entering your master password. 

To be able to access the password over multiple computers. you need to have the program on both computers and the encrypted password file need to be on both computers.
